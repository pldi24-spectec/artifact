# Artifact For "Bringing the WebAssembly Standard up to Speed with SpecTec"
This [artifact](https://github.com/pldi24-spectec/artifact) is for PLDI 2024 paper: "Bringing the WebAssembly Standard up to Speed with SpecTec" and includes SpecTec, a domain-specific language (DSL) and toolchain that facilitates both developing the Wasm specification and the generation of artifacts necessary to standardize new features.


## Getting Started
We support two ways to use SpecTec:

* Using a Docker container

* Building from source

### Using a docker container
We provide a Docker container with SpecTec and its dependencies. You can install the docker by following the instruction in https://docs.docker.com/get-started/ and download our docker image with the following command:
> WARNING: The docker image is 6GB large. Thus, be patient when you download it, and please assign more than 6GB of memory for the docker engine.
```
$ docker pull pldi24spectec/artifact
$ docker run --name artifact -it --rm pldi24spectec/artifact
```

### Building from source

* You will need `ocaml` installed with `dune`, `menhir`, and `mdx`.

* Have `python3` version 3.7 or higher with `pip3` installed.

* Install `sphinx` version 7.1.2 and `six` version 1.16.0 via `pip3` (default versions).
  ```
  $ pip3 install sphinx six
  ```

* Install `texlive-full` via your package manager.
  ```
  $ apt-get install texlive-full
  ```

* Then, you should be able to build the binary using the `make` command.
  ```
  $ (cd spectec; make)
  ```
  
* Check if the build was successful.
  ```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

We provide instructions to reproduce the results in the Evaluation section of the paper.

### 1) Correctness

In this section, we demonstrate the SpecTec's ability to correctly generate formal and prose specification, and execute the official test suite using the meta-level interpreter.

#### Formal and Prose Specification
SpecTec can generate the specification document in both formal and prose notation from the spec files given by the user.

We have made a script for generating the pdf document from the input files located in the `spectec/spec` directory.

The specification document is generated using the command below.
```
$ (cd spectec/test-prose; make pdf)
```
The generated pdf document is located at `spectec/test-prose/WebAssembly.pdf`. The pre-generated pdf is also available at `WebAssembly.pdf`

You can check that this document with formal and prose notations is very close to the respective parts of the [hand-written specification](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/).


#### Interpreter
SpecTec can can generate the meta-level interpreter for Wasm, which can run any wasm file.

We have made a script for executing the [official test-suite](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/tree/main/test/core), located in the `spectec/test-interpreter/spec-test` directory.

By running the `interpreter.sh`, you can see total 23,751 tests are passed. (This make take a few minutes)
```
$ (cd spectec; ./interpreter.sh)
dune build src/exe-watsup/main.exe
ln -f _build/default/src/exe-watsup/main.exe ./watsup

...

===== nop.wast =====
- 83/83 (100.00%)

Total [23751/23751] (100.00%; Normalized 100.00%)
```

### 2) Bug prevention

In this section, we demonstrate the SpecTec's ability to prevent the real-world spec bugs.

In the paper, we have identified the bugs that could have been prevented using SpecTec, and classified the bugs into four categories:
1. Type Erros
2. Prose Errors
3. Semantics Errors
4. Editorial Fixes

Among the four categories, prose errors and editorial fixes were confirmed by looking at the generated document, and checking the absence of such errors.

For rest of the two categories, we show that SpecTec can detect these errors during its type-checking phase and interpreter phase.

The patch files that injects each bugs into the spec files are located in the directory `spectec/spec-bugs`.

We made a script that injects each bugs into spec files by applying those patch files, and executes SpecTec with the injected spec:
```
$ (cd spectec; ./bug-prevention.sh)
```

Below are the expected results.

For type errors, you can see that SpecTec raises type error, with the error message indicating the location of the bug and the explanation for the bug.

```
===== spec-bugs/type-1 =====
Injecting error to spec-bugs/type-1/4-runtime.watsup ...

```

For semantics errors, you can see that SpecTec raises error during the execution of minimized official test suite, located at `spectec/test-interpreter/test-semantics.wast`.

```

### 3) Forward compatibility

In this section, we demonstrate the SpecTec's ability to handle Wasm's five proposals:
1. Typed Function References
2. Garbage Collection
3. Tail Calls
4. Multiple Memories
5. Extended Constant Expression

#### Formal and Prose Specification
We have extended the spec files with the proposals, and the extended spec files are available at the `spectec-forward` directory:

```
$ (cd spectec-forward; make)
```

Same as before, the specification document is generated using the command below.
```
$ (cd spectec-forward/test-prose; make pdf)
```

The generated pdf document is located at `spectec-forward/test-prose/WebAssembly.pdf`.
The pre-generated pdf is also available at `WebAssembly-forward.pdf`

#### Interpreter
As we explained in the paper, we borrowed reference interpreter for parsing the Wasm test suite.
We need different parser to parse the test suite corresponding to each proposal,
so we need to change the reference interpreter for each proposal accordingly.
Each implementation of SpecTec with different version of reference interpreter is located in the `spectec-gc`, `spectec-mm`, and `spectec-const` directroy.
Same as before, we have made a script for executing the official test-suite corresponding to each proposals.

##### a. function references, tail calls proposal, and garbage collection
The reference interpreter for gc proposal can also parse the test for function references and tail calls proposals, so we can run tests for all three of these proposals at once under `spectec-gc` directory.

For function references, total 78 tests are passed. (This make take a few minutes)
```
$ (cd spectec-gc; ./interpreter.sh function-references)
dune build src/exe-watsup/main.exe
ln -f _build/default/src/exe-watsup/main.exe ./watsup

...

===== return_call_ref.wast =====
- 35/35 (100.00%)

Total [78/78] (100.00%; Normalized 100.00%)
```

For tail call, total 78 tests are passed. (This make take a few minutes)
```
$ (cd spectec-gc; ./interpreter.sh tail-call)
dune build src/exe-watsup/main.exe
ln -f _build/default/src/exe-watsup/main.exe ./watsup

...

===== return_call.wast =====
- 31/31 (100.00%)

Total [78/78] (100.00%; Normalized 100.00%)
```

For gc, total 449 tests are passed.
```
$ (cd spectec-gc; ./interpreter.sh gc)
dune build src/exe-watsup/main.exe
ln -f _build/default/src/exe-watsup/main.exe ./watsup

...

===== ref_test.wast =====
- 69/69 (100.00%)

Total [449/449] (100.00%; Normalized 100.00%)
```

##### b. multiple memories proposal
For multiple memories, total 718 tests are passed.
```
$ (cd spectec-mm; ./interpreter.sh multi-memory)
dune build src/exe-watsup/main.exe
ln -f _build/default/src/exe-watsup/main.exe ./watsup

...

===== store1.wast =====
- 8/8 (100.00%)

Total [718/718] (100.00%; Normalized 100.00%)
```

##### c. extended constant expressions proposal
For extended constant expressions, total 8 tests are passed.
```
$ (cd spectec-const; ./interpreter.sh extended-const)
dune build src/exe-watsup/main.exe
ln -f _build/default/src/exe-watsup/main.exe ./watsup

...

===== data.wast =====
- 4/4 (100.00%)

===== global.wast =====
- 4/4 (100.00%)

Total [8/8] (100.00%; Normalized 100.00%)
```

In total, 1,331 tests in the five proposals are passed.
